<p>“<i>I say we have despised literature; what do we, as a nation, care
about books? How much do you think we spend altogether on our
libraries, public or private, as compared with what we spend on our
horses? If a man spends lavishly on his library, you call him mad&mdash;a
bibliomaniac. But you never call one a horse-maniac, though men
ruin themselves every day by their horses, and you do not hear of people
ruining themselves by their books. Or, to go lower still, how much do
you think the contents of the book-shelves of the United Kingdom, public
and private, would fetch, as compared with the contents of its wine-cellars?
What position would its expenditure on literature take as compared
with its expenditure on luxurious eating? We talk of food for
the mind, as of food for the body: now, a good book contains such food
inexhaustible: it is provision for life, and for the best part of us; yet
how long most people would look at the best book before they would give
the price of a large turbot for it! Though there have been men who
have pinched their stomachs and bared their backs to buy a book, whose
libraries were cheaper to them, I think, in the end, than most men’s
dinners are. We are few of us put to such a trial, and more the pity;
for, indeed, a precious thing is all the more precious to us if it has been
won by work or economy; and if public libraries were half as costly as
public dinners, or books cost the tenth part of what bracelets do, even
foolish men and women might sometimes suspect there was good in reading
as well as in munching and sparkling; whereas the very cheapness
of literature is making even wiser people forget that if a book is worth
reading it is worth buying.</i>”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sesame and Lilies; or, King’s

<h3><i>Belgravia Magazine.</i></h3>

<p><i>That the purpose with which “BELGRAVIA” was originated has been
fulfilled, is shown by the popularity that has attended it since its first appearance.
Aiming, as may be inferred from its name, at supplying the most
refined and cultivated section of London society with intellectual pabulum suited
to its requirements, it sprang at once into public favour, and has since remained
one of the most extensively read and widely circulated of periodicals. In passing
into new hands it has experienced no structural change or modification. Increased
energy and increased capital have been employed in elevating it to the
highest standard of excellence, but all the features that had won public appreciation
have been retained, and the Magazine still seeks its principal support in the
homes of Belgravia. As the means through which the writer most readily reaches
the heart of the general public, and in consequence as the most important of aids
in the establishment of morals and the formation of character, fiction still remains
a principal feature in the Magazine. Two Serial Stories accordingly run through
its pages; supplemented by short Stories, Novelettes, and narrative or dramatic
Sketches: whilst Essays, Social, Biographical, and Humorous; Scientific Discoveries
brought to the level of popular comprehension, and treated with a light
touch; Poetry, of the highest character; and records of Adventure and Travel,
form the remaining portion of the contents. Especial care is now bestowed
upon the illustrations, of which no fewer than four appear in each number.
Beyond the design of illustrating the article they accompany, these aim at maintaining
a position as works of art, both as regards drawing and engraving.
In short, whatever claims the Magazine before possessed to favour have now been
enhanced, and the Publishers can but leave the result to a public that has seldom
failed to appreciate all earnest, persistent, and well-directed efforts for its amusement
and benefit.</i></p>

<p><i>In seeking to restore the “GENTLEMAN’S MAGAZINE” to the position
it formerly held, the Publishers do not lose sight of the changed conditions
under which it now appears. While maintaining an historical continuity which
dates back to the reign of George the Second, there will be no attempt to burden
the present with the weight of a distant past, or to adhere slavishly to traditions
the application of which is unsuited to the altered conditions of society at the
present time. It is sought to render the Magazine to the gentleman of to-day
what in earlier times it proved to the gentleman of a past generation. New
features will be introduced to take the place of those which disappear; in the
most important respects, however, the connecting links between the present and
the past will be closest. Biography and History, which have always formed a
conspicuous portion of the contents, will retain the prominence assigned them,
and will be treated with the added breadth that springs from increased familiarity
with authorities and more exact appreciation of the province of the
Biographer and the Historian. Science, which confers upon the age special
eminence, will have its latest conclusions and forecasts presented in a manner
which shall bring them within the grasp of the general reader. The philosophical
aspect of Politics, the matters which affect Imperial interests, will be
separated from the rivalries of party, and will receive a due share of attention.
Archæology (under which comprehensive head may be included Genealogy, Topography,
and other similar matters), Natural History, Sport and Adventure,
Poetry, Belles Lettres, Art in all its manifestations, will constitute a portion
of the contents; and Essays upon social subjects will, as heretofore, be interspersed.
Under the head of Table Talk matters of current interest will be
discussed, and facts of historic value will be preserved. A Work of Fiction by
some novelist of highest position will run through the pages of the Magazine,
and will be illustrated by artists of known excellence. With a full sense of
what is involved in their promise, and with a firm resolution to abide by their
pledges, the Publishers undertake to spare no exertion that is necessary to secure
the highest class of contributions, to place the Magazine in the first rank of
serials, and to fit it to take its place on the table and on the shelves of all classes
of cultivated Englishmen.</i></p>

Mr. Moyr Smith’s illustrations, too, are admirable. Look at that

mind, and a very uncommon mind too&mdash;that he is a fairy rabbit, and that he is
posing as chief adviser to some one&mdash;without reading even a word of the story.
Again, notice the fairy-like effect of the little picture of the fairy-bird ‘Don’t-forget-me,’
flying away back into fairy-land. A more perfectly dream-like impression

<p>“<i>The great charm of the book lies in the clever and artistic way the dialogue
is managed, and the diverse and various expedients by which, whilst the love of
thought on every page is kept at a high pitch, it never loses its realistic aspect....
It is giving high praise to a work of this sort to say that it absolutely
needs to be taken as a whole, and that disjointed extracts here and there would
entirely fail to convey any idea of the artistic unity, the careful and conscientious
sequence of what is evidently the brilliant outcome of much patient thought and
study.... Enough has now been said to recommend these volumes to any
reader who desires something above the usual novel, something which will open
up lanes of thought in his own mind, and insensibly introduce a higher standard
into his daily life.... Here is novelty indeed, as well as originality, and
to anyone who can appreciate or understand ‘The New Republic’ it cannot
fail to be a rare treat.</i>”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Observer.</span></p>

wine’ determined him strictly to certain modes of sympathy and of utterance, and
these to a large extent of a slightly artificial character. This volume will serve to
show him in other, and certainly as attractive, aspects, while, at the same time,
enabling us to a considerable extent to see how faithfully he developed himself on
the poetical or fanciful side.... This is a book which claims, as it ought to
obtain, various classes of readers, and we trust that the very mixed elements of
interest in it may not conflict with its obtaining them. For the lightest reader

<p>“<i>In ‘Miss Misanthrope’ Mr. McCarthy has added a new and delightful portrait
to his gallery of Englishwomen.... It is a novel which may be sipped like
choice wine; it is one to linger over and ponder; to be enjoyed like fine, sweet air,
or good company, for it is pervaded by a perfume of honesty and humour, of high
feeling, of kindly penetrating humour, of good sense, and wide knowledge of the
world, of a mind richly cultivated and amply stored. There is scarcely a page in
these volumes in which we do not find some fine remark or felicitous reflection of
piercing, yet gentle and indulgent irony.</i>”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Daily News.</span>

be amusing also. It contains the very vocabulary of unrestrained humour, and
oddity, and grotesqueness. In a word, it provides valuable material both for the
student of language and the student of human nature.</i>”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Academy.</span>

seven plays by which Sheridan is best known, but a collection also of his poetical
pieces which are less familiar to the public, sketches of unfinished dramas, selections
from his reported witticisms, and extracts from his principal speeches. To these
is prefixed a short but well-written memoir, giving the chief facts in Sheridan’s
literary and political career; so that, with this volume in his hand, the student
may consider himself tolerably well furnished with all that is necessary for a
general comprehension of the subject of it.</i>”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pall Mall Gazette.</span></p>

<p>“<i>It would have been a real loss to bibliographical literature had copyright
difficulties deprived the general public of this very amusing collection. One of
Thackeray’s habits, from his schoolboy days, was to ornament the margins and
blank pages of the books he had in use with caricature illustrations of their
contents. This gave special value to the sale of his library, and is almost cause
for regret that it could not have been preserved in its integrity. Thackeray’s
place in literature is eminent enough to have made this an interest to future
generations. The anonymous editor has done the best that he could to compensate
for the lack of this. It is an admirable addendum, not only to his collected
works, but also to any memoir of him that has been, or that is likely to be,
written.</i>”&mdash;<span class="smcap">British Quarterly Review.</span></p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
